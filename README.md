pcjo - Pre-Compiler Java Obfuscator

Pretty self-explainitory.
It's really just "a lot of" text parsing, so there will probably be lots of limitations to it.

Right now it only scans a single file and identifies class, imports, variables, and methods names.

Stuff to be implemented:
-actually creating an obfuscated file
-reading from multiple files or a folder
-enumerations
-manual ignore
-some kind of interface?
