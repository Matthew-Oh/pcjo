Pretty self-explainitory.
It's really just "a lot of" text parsing, so there will probably be lots of limitations to it.

Scans a single file and identifies class, imports, variables, and methods names.
Creates codenames for class, variable and methods.
Creates new file using codenames.

Stuff to be implemented:
-reading from multiple files or a folder
-enumerations
-manual ignore
-some kind of interface?
