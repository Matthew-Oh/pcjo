# pcjo - Pre-Compiler Java Obfuscator

Obfuscates Java code by reading Java source files and creating a new version with obfuscated identifiers.  
Parses the code text to interperent and obfuscate the code.

## Usage

Pass the name of a Java file or folder of Java files that is in the input folder as a command line argument to Obfuscator's main method.  
You can ignore obfuscation for new identifiers by commenting `//<PJCO_IGNORE_#>`, replacing the # with the number of new indentifiers to be ignored after the comment.
